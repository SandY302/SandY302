With a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronics and Telecom Engineering, along with professional experience in cloud solutions, IT infrastructure, and endpoint security, I am eager to contribute to your team. Over the past few years, I have honed my skills in ServiceNow, Citrix environments, MDM, and cloud security, and I am confident that my expertise aligns with the requirements of your organization.
In my most recent role as an IT Infrastructure Engineer with CREDILA, I led several initiatives, including mobile device deployment and security policies using ScaleFusion and Microsoft Intune. I also streamlined device enrollment processes and managed cloud security solutions like Netskope. I implemented CrowdStrike Falcon for enhanced endpoint protection, leading to improved security posture across the organization. These experiences, along with my technical expertise, have prepared me to excel in your organization.
Previously, as a ServiceNow Analyst at Wipro, I was responsible for the installation, configuration, and maintenance of Citrix environments, automation of tasks, and troubleshooting application issues. These experiences have strengthened my problem-solving abilities, vendor management, and technical support skills.
I am particularly excited about the opportunity to bring my skills in automation, endpoint security, and cloud solutions to your organization. I am committed to continuous learning and growth, as well as to contributing to the technological advancements that drive business growth.
