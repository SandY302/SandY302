As a highly skilled IT Infrastructure Engineer with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering, I specialize in cloud solutions, IT infrastructure, and endpoint security. Over the years, I have cultivated expertise in ServiceNow, Citrix environments, Mobile Device Management (MDM), and cloud security. I am passionate about leveraging my skills to drive technological advancements and contribute to organizational growth.

In my recent role at CREDILA, I led initiatives focusing on mobile device deployment, security policies using ScaleFusion and Microsoft Intune, and the management of cloud security solutions like Netskope. Additionally, I implemented CrowdStrike Falcon for endpoint protection, which significantly enhanced the organization's security posture. My focus on automation, security, and cloud solutions has equipped me to effectively address complex challenges and improve operational efficiency.

Previously, I worked as a ServiceNow Analyst at Wipro, where I contributed to the installation, configuration, and ongoing maintenance of Citrix environments. My responsibilities also included automating tasks, troubleshooting application issues, and offering technical support, which enhanced my problem-solving skills and ability to manage vendor relationships.

Driven by a commitment to continuous learning and growth, I strive to stay at the forefront of industry advancements. I am eager to apply my skills in automation, endpoint security, and cloud solutions to solve complex problems and add value to any organization I work with.

Feel free to explore my repositories for projects that showcase my work in cloud security, endpoint management, and automation.
